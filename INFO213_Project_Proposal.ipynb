For travelers and businesses, predicting air ticket prices is a key task that can save costs and facilitate better planning. \"Easemytrip\" is an Internet platform for booking air tickets, and thus it is a platform used by potential passengers to purchase tickets. The aim of this project is to analyze the flight reservation dataset obtained from the \"Ease My Trip\" website to establish a prediction model, using machine learning techniques to estimate the cost of air tickets based on multiple input features."

Challenges to address include handling categorical variables, extracting useful information from time-based fields, and accounting for missing values and potential outliers. Our group will compare different regression models to find the most effective one for accurate fare prediction."
